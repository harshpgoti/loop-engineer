## Loop Engineer integration

Inherits `docs/SKILL_CONTRACT.md`.

This capability is selected by `scripts/agent_skill_router.py` and executed through
`skills/agent-development/SKILL.md`. Record its concrete decisions and outputs in the
appropriate `agent/` artifact (`AGENT_ARCHITECTURE.md`, `HARNESS.md`,
`ORCHESTRATION.md`, `MEMORY.md`, `OPERATIONS.md`, or `evals/`) and reconcile tasks,
gates, decisions, and handoff before closeout.

Loop Engineer rules override provider-specific examples below. Examples naming a
particular model, CLI, hook system, scheduler, MCP server, or agent host are adapters,
not mandatory dependencies. Prefer deterministic local mechanisms already present in
the active product. Installing software, transferring context to another provider,
enabling background execution, spending money, or changing external state requires the
authorization that action normally requires. Never place secrets or sensitive data in
prompts, traces, fixtures, memory, or reports.

**Approval:** obtain it immediately before any high-risk external action. **Rollback:**
record how generated state, schedules, configuration, or code can be reverted before
mutation. **Validation:** verify the capability through its public interface and required
behavioral evals. **Output:** report artifacts changed, evidence, test/eval results, budgets,
remaining gates, and the next action.
# Agent Payment Execution (x402)

Enable AI agents to make policy-gated payments with built-in spending controls. Uses the x402 HTTP payment protocol and MCP tools so agents can pay for external services, APIs, or other agents without custodial risk.

## When to Use

Use when: your agent needs to pay for an API call, purchase a service, settle with another agent, enforce per-task spending limits, or manage a non-custodial wallet. Pairs naturally with cost-aware-llm-pipeline and security-review skills.

## Decision Tree

Choose the integration path based on whether your agent is buying access to a paid API or charging others for one:

| Need | Recommended path |
|------|------------------|
| Agent pays a 402-gated API on Base or another agentwallet-supported chain | Use `agentwallet-sdk` as an MCP payment server with strict spending policy |
| Agent pays a 402-gated API on X Layer | Use an x402-compatible payment provider; consult the provider's skill and treat any earlier alias as deprecated |
| TypeScript API charges agents | Use the x402-compatible TypeScript seller SDK docs for Express, Hono, Fastify, or Next.js |
| Go API charges agents | Use the x402-compatible Go seller SDK docs for Gin, Echo, or `net/http` |
| Rust API charges agents | Use the x402-compatible Rust seller SDK docs for Axum |
| Java API charges agents | Use the x402-compatible Java seller SDK docs for Spring Boot 2/3, Java EE, or Jakarta |
| Python API charges agents | Check the current x402-compatible payment provider repository before implementation; a Python seller guide may not be available |

## Supported Networks

- `agentwallet-sdk`: use the package docs to confirm current network coverage before production. Base Sepolia is the safest development default; Base mainnet is the production path called out by the original skill.
- x402-compatible payment provider / X Layer: current seller docs target X Layer (`eip155:196`) and USDT0 settlement. Fetch current SDK docs before generating production code because payment packages and facilitator behavior can change quickly.

## How It Works

### x402 Protocol
x402 extends HTTP 402 (Payment Required) into a machine-negotiable flow. When a server returns `402`, the agent's payment tool negotiates price, checks budget, signs a transaction, and retries only inside the policy and confirmation boundary set by the orchestrator.

### Spending Controls
Every payment tool call enforces a `SpendingPolicy`:
- **Per-task budget** — max spend for a single agent action
- **Per-session budget** — cumulative limit across an entire session
- **Allowlisted recipients** — restrict which addresses/services the agent can pay
- **Rate limits** — max transactions per minute/hour

### Non-Custodial Wallets
Agents hold their own keys via ERC-4337 smart accounts. The orchestrator sets policy before delegation; the agent can only spend within bounds. No pooled funds, no custodial risk.

## MCP Integration

The payment layer exposes standard MCP tools that slot into any agent harness or agent harness setup.

> **Security note**: Always pin the package version. This tool manages private keys — unpinned `npx` installs introduce supply-chain risk.

### Option A: agentwallet-sdk (Base / multi-chain)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "agentpay": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["agentwallet-sdk@6.0.0"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Available Tools (agent-callable)

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `get_balance` | Check agent wallet balance |
| `send_payment` | Send payment to address or ENS |
| `check_spending` | Query remaining budget |
| `list_transactions` | Audit trail of all payments |

> **Note**: Spending policy is set by the **orchestrator** before delegating to the agent — not by the agent itself. This prevents agents from escalating their own spending limits. Configure policy via `set_policy` in your orchestration layer or pre-task hook, never as an agent-callable tool.

### Option B: x402-compatible payment provider (X Layer)

Use this path for X Layer x402, Multi-Party Payment (MPP), session payment, charge, and A2A charge flows.

For buyer-side agent flows:

1. Install or reference the current x402-compatible payment provider skill repository.
2. Use the approved payment adapter as the dispatcher.
3. Treat earlier aliases as deprecated compatibility shims, not as the canonical skill.
4. Require explicit user confirmation before wallet status checks or payment actions. Do not hide payment execution behind a generic tool call.

For seller-side API flows, fetch the latest language-specific guide before generating code:

| Runtime | Current guide |
|---------|---------------|
| TypeScript | `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<x402-provider>/payments/main/typescript/SELLER.md` |
| Go | `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<x402-provider>/payments/main/go/x402/SELLER.md` |
| Rust | `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<x402-provider>/payments/main/rust/x402/SELLER.md` |
| Java | `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<x402-provider>/payments/main/java/SELLER.md` |

Do not copy examples from older docs without checking the current x402-compatible payment provider repository. Current guidance uses the provider's agent-payments protocol as the dispatcher, and Java seller docs are now available.

## Examples

### Budget enforcement in an MCP client

When building an orchestrator that calls the agentpay MCP server, enforce budgets before dispatching paid tool calls.

> **Prerequisites**: Install the package before adding the MCP config — `npx` without `-y` will prompt for confirmation in non-interactive environments, causing the server to hang: `npm install -g agentwallet-sdk@6.0.0`

```typescript
import { Client } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/index.js";
import { StdioClientTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/stdio.js";

async function main() {
  // 1. Validate credentials before constructing the transport.
  //    A missing key must fail immediately — never let the subprocess start without auth.
  const walletKey = process.env.WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY;
  if (!walletKey) {
    throw new Error("WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY is not set — refusing to start payment server");
  }

  // Connect to the agentpay MCP server via stdio transport.
  // Whitelist only the env vars the server needs — never forward all of process.env
  // to a third-party subprocess that manages private keys.
  const transport = new StdioClientTransport({
    command: "npx",
    args: ["agentwallet-sdk@6.0.0"],
    env: {
      PATH: process.env.PATH ?? "",
      NODE_ENV: process.env.NODE_ENV ?? "production",
      WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY: walletKey,
    },
  });
  const agentpay = new Client({ name: "orchestrator", version: "1.0.0" });
  await agentpay.connect(transport);

  // 2. Set spending policy before delegating to the agent.
  //    Always verify success — a silent failure means no controls are active.
  const policyResult = await agentpay.callTool({
    name: "set_policy",
    arguments: {
      per_task_budget: 0.50,
      per_session_budget: 5.00,
      allowlisted_recipients: ["api.example.com"],
    },
  });
  if (policyResult.isError) {
    throw new Error(
      `Failed to set spending policy — do not delegate: ${JSON.stringify(policyResult.content)}`
    );
  }

  // 3. Use preToolCheck before any paid action
  await preToolCheck(agentpay, 0.01);
}

// Pre-tool hook: fail-closed budget enforcement with four distinct error paths.
async function preToolCheck(agentpay: Client, apiCost: number): Promise<void> {
  // Path 1: Reject invalid input (NaN/Infinity bypass the < comparison)
  if (!Number.isFinite(apiCost) || apiCost < 0) {
    throw new Error(`Invalid apiCost: ${apiCost} — action blocked`);
  }

  // Path 2: Transport/connectivity failure
  let result;
  try {
    result = await agentpay.callTool({ name: "check_spending" });
  } catch (err) {
    throw new Error(`Payment service unreachable — action blocked: ${err}`);
  }

  // Path 3: Tool returned an error (e.g., auth failure, wallet not initialised)
  if (result.isError) {
    throw new Error(
      `check_spending failed — action blocked: ${JSON.stringify(result.content)}`
    );
  }

  // Path 4: Parse and validate the response shape
  let remaining: number;
  try {
    const parsed = JSON.parse(
      (result.content as Array<{ text: string }>)[0].text
    );
    if (!Number.isFinite(parsed?.remaining)) {
      throw new TypeError("missing or non-finite 'remaining' field");
    }
    remaining = parsed.remaining;
  } catch (err) {
    throw new Error(
      `check_spending returned unexpected format — action blocked: ${err}`
    );
  }

  // Path 5: Budget exceeded
  if (remaining < apiCost) {
    throw new Error(
      `Budget exceeded: need $${apiCost} but only $${remaining} remaining`
    );
  }
}

main().catch((err) => {
  console.error(err);
  process.exitCode = 1;
});
```

## Best Practices

- **Set budgets before delegation**: When spawning sub-agents, attach a SpendingPolicy via your orchestration layer. Never give an agent unlimited spend.
- **Pin your dependencies**: Always specify an exact version in your MCP config (e.g., `agentwallet-sdk@6.0.0`). Verify package integrity before deploying to production.
- **Audit trails**: Use `list_transactions` in post-task hooks to log what was spent and why.
- **Fail closed**: If the payment tool is unreachable, block the paid action — don't fall back to unmetered access.
- **Pair with security-review**: Payment tools are high-privilege. Apply the same scrutiny as shell access.
- **Test with testnets first**: Use Base Sepolia for development; switch to Base mainnet for production.

## Stop Conditions and Rollback

A mutating skill declares when to halt and how to revert, before it runs. This section
is required by the canonical skill contract (`docs/SKILL_CONTRACT.md` "Risk and approval")
and is the E3 pattern adopted in round 4.

### When to stop

- **Three failed attempts at the same step.** Retrying past three means the
  hypothesis is wrong, not the execution. Stop, record what was tried, and
  escalate to the user as a doubt.
- **A change introduces more errors than it resolves.** Net negative progress
  is a regression, not a fix. Revert the change; record the failure mode.
- **A gate fails that the plan said must pass.** A gate is a contract; a
  failing gate is the chain telling you the work is not done. Stop and resolve.
- **The active task's `acceptance` criteria become unreachable** because of
  upstream changes. The plan is no longer valid; the task needs re-design,
  not more attempts.
- **Cost drift outside the budget.** A skill that consumes tokens or dollars
  unboundedly is a runaway; stop and report.

### When to escalate to the user

- **High-risk external actions** (publish, deploy, spend, destructive,
  privileged) require explicit user approval per `AGENTS.md` #5. The skill
  prepares the change, names the risk, and waits.
- **A blocker that is human-owned.** The blocker is a question only the
  user can answer (a stakeholder's call, a missing credential, a sign-off).
  Record it in `DOUBTS.md` and `HANDOFF.md`; do not invent an answer.
- **A goal-direction change.** The plan no longer matches what the user
  wants. The chain halts; the user re-plans.

### Rollback path

- **A single-task rollback** is `git revert <task-sha>` (or `git restore` for
  staged-only changes) followed by re-running the active feature's
  `converge-report` to confirm the rollback did not regress the rest of
  the build.
- **A multi-task rollback** is a feature-level revert: identify the feature
  commit range from `.loop/active-feature.json`, revert the range, then run
  `feature-converge` to confirm the surface is clean.
- **A state-only rollback** (files, configs, but no code) is a `git restore
  <path>` + `git clean -fd <path>` for the recorded paths. The skill's
  output records which paths it touched; the rollback reverses exactly
  those.
- **A data-only rollback** is database- and tenant-scoped; record the
  affected rows in the change record, run the inverse migration, and
  verify the diff matches the change record before declaring done.
- **A deploy rollback** is the prior version's artifact promoted through
  the same path the deploy took; `cicd-release/SKILL.md` carries the
  per-deploy rollback procedure.

A rollback that cannot be performed in one step is a planning problem.
Stop and re-plan; do not chain partial rollbacks.
