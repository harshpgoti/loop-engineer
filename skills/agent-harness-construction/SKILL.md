## Loop Engineer integration

Inherits `docs/SKILL_CONTRACT.md`.

This capability is selected by `scripts/agent_skill_router.py` and executed through
`skills/agent-development/SKILL.md`. Record its concrete decisions and outputs in the
appropriate `agent/` artifact (`AGENT_ARCHITECTURE.md`, `HARNESS.md`,
`ORCHESTRATION.md`, `MEMORY.md`, `OPERATIONS.md`, or `evals/`) and reconcile tasks,
gates, decisions, and handoff before closeout.

Loop Engineer rules override provider-specific examples below. Examples naming a
particular model, CLI, hook system, scheduler, MCP server, or agent host are adapters,
not mandatory dependencies. Prefer deterministic local mechanisms already present in
the active product. Installing software, transferring context to another provider,
enabling background execution, spending money, or changing external state requires the
authorization that action normally requires. Never place secrets or sensitive data in
prompts, traces, fixtures, memory, or reports.

**Approval:** obtain it immediately before any high-risk external action. **Rollback:**
record how generated state, schedules, configuration, or code can be reverted before
mutation. **Validation:** verify the capability through its public interface and required
behavioral evals. **Output:** report artifacts changed, evidence, test/eval results, budgets,
remaining gates, and the next action.
# Agent Harness Construction

Use this skill when you are improving how an agent plans, calls tools, recovers from errors, and converges on completion.

## Core Model

Agent output quality is constrained by:
1. Action space quality
2. Observation quality
3. Recovery quality
4. Context budget quality

## Action Space Design

1. Use stable, explicit tool names.
2. Keep inputs schema-first and narrow.
3. Return deterministic output shapes.
4. Avoid catch-all tools unless isolation is impossible.

## Granularity Rules

- Use micro-tools for high-risk operations (deploy, migration, permissions).
- Use medium tools for common edit/read/search loops.
- Use macro-tools only when round-trip overhead is the dominant cost.

## Observation Design

Every tool response should include:
- `status`: success|warning|error
- `summary`: one-line result
- `next_actions`: actionable follow-ups
- `artifacts`: file paths / IDs

## Error Recovery Contract

For every error path, include:
- root cause hint
- safe retry instruction
- explicit stop condition

## Context Budgeting

1. Keep system prompt minimal and invariant.
2. Move large guidance into skills loaded on demand.
3. Prefer references to files over inlining long documents.
4. Compact at phase boundaries, not arbitrary token thresholds.

## Architecture Pattern Guidance

- ReAct: best for exploratory tasks with uncertain path.
- Function-calling: best for structured deterministic flows.
- Hybrid (recommended): ReAct planning + typed tool execution.

## Benchmarking

Track:
- completion rate
- retries per task
- pass@1 and pass@3
- cost per successful task

## Anti-Patterns

- Too many tools with overlapping semantics.
- Opaque tool output with no recovery hints.
- Error-only output without next steps.
- Context overloading with irrelevant references.


## Stop Conditions and Rollback

A mutating skill declares when to halt and how to revert, before it runs. This section
is required by the canonical skill contract (`docs/SKILL_CONTRACT.md` "Risk and approval")
and is the E3 pattern adopted in round 4.

### When to stop

- **Three failed attempts at the same step.** Retrying past three means the
  hypothesis is wrong, not the execution. Stop, record what was tried, and
  escalate to the user as a doubt.
- **A change introduces more errors than it resolves.** Net negative progress
  is a regression, not a fix. Revert the change; record the failure mode.
- **A gate fails that the plan said must pass.** A gate is a contract; a
  failing gate is the chain telling you the work is not done. Stop and resolve.
- **The active task's `acceptance` criteria become unreachable** because of
  upstream changes. The plan is no longer valid; the task needs re-design,
  not more attempts.
- **Cost drift outside the budget.** A skill that consumes tokens or dollars
  unboundedly is a runaway; stop and report.

### When to escalate to the user

- **High-risk external actions** (publish, deploy, spend, destructive,
  privileged) require explicit user approval per `AGENTS.md` #5. The skill
  prepares the change, names the risk, and waits.
- **A blocker that is human-owned.** The blocker is a question only the
  user can answer (a stakeholder's call, a missing credential, a sign-off).
  Record it in `DOUBTS.md` and `HANDOFF.md`; do not invent an answer.
- **A goal-direction change.** The plan no longer matches what the user
  wants. The chain halts; the user re-plans.

### Rollback path

- **A single-task rollback** is `git revert <task-sha>` (or `git restore` for
  staged-only changes) followed by re-running the active feature's
  `converge-report` to confirm the rollback did not regress the rest of
  the build.
- **A multi-task rollback** is a feature-level revert: identify the feature
  commit range from `.loop/active-feature.json`, revert the range, then run
  `feature-converge` to confirm the surface is clean.
- **A state-only rollback** (files, configs, but no code) is a `git restore
  <path>` + `git clean -fd <path>` for the recorded paths. The skill's
  output records which paths it touched; the rollback reverses exactly
  those.
- **A data-only rollback** is database- and tenant-scoped; record the
  affected rows in the change record, run the inverse migration, and
  verify the diff matches the change record before declaring done.
- **A deploy rollback** is the prior version's artifact promoted through
  the same path the deploy took; `cicd-release/SKILL.md` carries the
  per-deploy rollback procedure.

A rollback that cannot be performed in one step is a planning problem.
Stop and re-plan; do not chain partial rollbacks.
