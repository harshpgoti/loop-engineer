## Loop Engineer integration

Inherits `docs/SKILL_CONTRACT.md`.

This capability is selected by `scripts/agent_skill_router.py` and executed through
`skills/agent-development/SKILL.md`. Record its concrete decisions and outputs in the
appropriate `agent/` artifact (`AGENT_ARCHITECTURE.md`, `HARNESS.md`,
`ORCHESTRATION.md`, `MEMORY.md`, `OPERATIONS.md`, or `evals/`) and reconcile tasks,
gates, decisions, and handoff before closeout.

Loop Engineer rules override provider-specific examples below. Examples naming a
particular model, CLI, hook system, scheduler, MCP server, or agent host are adapters,
not mandatory dependencies. Prefer deterministic local mechanisms already present in
the active product. Installing software, transferring context to another provider,
enabling background execution, spending money, or changing external state requires the
authorization that action normally requires. Never place secrets or sensitive data in
prompts, traces, fixtures, memory, or reports.

**Approval:** obtain it immediately before any high-risk external action. **Rollback:**
record how generated state, schedules, configuration, or code can be reverted before
mutation. **Validation:** verify the capability through its public interface and required
behavioral evals. **Output:** report artifacts changed, evidence, test/eval results, budgets,
remaining gates, and the next action.
# Agentic Engineering

Use this skill for engineering workflows where AI agents perform most implementation work and humans enforce quality and risk controls.

## Operating Principles

1. Define completion criteria before execution.
2. Decompose work into agent-sized units.
3. Route model tiers by task complexity.
4. Measure with evals and regression checks.

## Eval-First Loop

1. Define capability eval and regression eval.
2. Run baseline and capture failure signatures.
3. Execute implementation.
4. Re-run evals and compare deltas.

## Task Decomposition

Apply the 15-minute unit rule:
- each unit should be independently verifiable
- each unit should have a single dominant risk
- each unit should expose a clear done condition

## Model Routing

- Haiku: classification, boilerplate transforms, narrow edits
- Sonnet: implementation and refactors
- Opus: architecture, root-cause analysis, multi-file invariants

## Session Strategy

- Continue session for closely-coupled units.
- Start fresh session after major phase transitions.
- Compact after milestone completion, not during active debugging.

## Review Focus for AI-Generated Code

Prioritize:
- invariants and edge cases
- error boundaries
- security and auth assumptions
- hidden coupling and rollout risk

Do not waste review cycles on style-only disagreements when automated format/lint already enforce style.

## Cost Discipline

Track per task:
- model
- token estimate
- retries
- wall-clock time
- success/failure

Escalate model tier only when lower tier fails with a clear reasoning gap.


## Stop Conditions and Rollback

A mutating skill declares when to halt and how to revert, before it runs. This section
is required by the canonical skill contract (`docs/SKILL_CONTRACT.md` "Risk and approval")
and is the E3 pattern adopted in round 4.

### When to stop

- **Three failed attempts at the same step.** Retrying past three means the
  hypothesis is wrong, not the execution. Stop, record what was tried, and
  escalate to the user as a doubt.
- **A change introduces more errors than it resolves.** Net negative progress
  is a regression, not a fix. Revert the change; record the failure mode.
- **A gate fails that the plan said must pass.** A gate is a contract; a
  failing gate is the chain telling you the work is not done. Stop and resolve.
- **The active task's `acceptance` criteria become unreachable** because of
  upstream changes. The plan is no longer valid; the task needs re-design,
  not more attempts.
- **Cost drift outside the budget.** A skill that consumes tokens or dollars
  unboundedly is a runaway; stop and report.

### When to escalate to the user

- **High-risk external actions** (publish, deploy, spend, destructive,
  privileged) require explicit user approval per `AGENTS.md` #5. The skill
  prepares the change, names the risk, and waits.
- **A blocker that is human-owned.** The blocker is a question only the
  user can answer (a stakeholder's call, a missing credential, a sign-off).
  Record it in `DOUBTS.md` and `HANDOFF.md`; do not invent an answer.
- **A goal-direction change.** The plan no longer matches what the user
  wants. The chain halts; the user re-plans.

### Rollback path

- **A single-task rollback** is `git revert <task-sha>` (or `git restore` for
  staged-only changes) followed by re-running the active feature's
  `converge-report` to confirm the rollback did not regress the rest of
  the build.
- **A multi-task rollback** is a feature-level revert: identify the feature
  commit range from `.loop/active-feature.json`, revert the range, then run
  `feature-converge` to confirm the surface is clean.
- **A state-only rollback** (files, configs, but no code) is a `git restore
  <path>` + `git clean -fd <path>` for the recorded paths. The skill's
  output records which paths it touched; the rollback reverses exactly
  those.
- **A data-only rollback** is database- and tenant-scoped; record the
  affected rows in the change record, run the inverse migration, and
  verify the diff matches the change record before declaring done.
- **A deploy rollback** is the prior version's artifact promoted through
  the same path the deploy took; `cicd-release/SKILL.md` carries the
  per-deploy rollback procedure.

A rollback that cannot be performed in one step is a planning problem.
Stop and re-plan; do not chain partial rollbacks.
