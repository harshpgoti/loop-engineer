# Loop Engineer - Data Layout

Loop Engineer separates **updatable app code** from **durable memory/data** -
`app/` never mixes with data, in both global and local modes.

Works the same on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Global layout: `~/.loop-engineer/`

```text
~/.loop-engineer/
├── app/                     # updatable tool runtime (git clone; loop update)
├── bin/loop                 # CLI entry point
└── data/                    # ALL global memory/data - nothing else lives loose here
    ├── registry/
    │   └── workspaces.json  # registered local product folders
    ├── memories/            # global MEMORY.md, USER.md, SOUL.md
    ├── state.db             # global session search (SQLite FTS5)
    ├── skills/              # global procedural skills
    ├── secrets.env          # user secrets, if any (chmod 600)
    ├── plan/                # product plan: main_plan.md + step plans
    ├── DOUBTS.md
    └── ...
```

## Local layout: `<product-folder>/.loop-engineer/`

A local product folder gets the exact same split, just rooted one level
deeper - `app/` doesn't apply locally (the tool runtime stays global), but
**all** memory/data is nested under a single hidden `.loop-engineer/` folder
so it never mixes with your actual product code:

```text
my-product/
├── src/                     # your product code - untouched by Loop Engineer
├── package.json
└── .loop-engineer/          # ALL local memory/data, hidden away
    ├── memories/
    │   ├── MEMORY.md
    │   ├── USER.md
    │   └── SOUL.md
    ├── state.db
    ├── skills/
    ├── plan/                # main_plan.md + step plans
    ├── docs/
    ├── .ai/
    ├── DOUBTS.md, TASKS.yml, GATES.yml, DECISIONS.md, ...
    └── .loop-workspace-version
```

## Two memory modes

| Mode | Data root | When used |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| **Global** (default) | `~/.loop-engineer/data/` | Installer default; no local loop data in cwd |
| **Local** | `<product-folder>/.loop-engineer/` | `loop setup --use-cwd` or `--memory-mode local` |

### Auto-detection

When you run `/plan-loop`, `/loop-engine`, or any loop command:

1. Loop checks the **current folder** (and parents) for a `.loop-engineer/` subfolder with local loop data (`memories/`, `.loop-workspace-version`, etc.)
2. **If found** → uses `<that-folder>/.loop-engineer/` as the data root
3. **If not** → uses global data in `~/.loop-engineer/data/`

Example: set up `H:/POC/QEAutoAI` once with local mode, close the terminal, come back later - `/plan-loop` automatically uses `H:/POC/QEAutoAI/.loop-engineer/` again, from anywhere inside that product folder (including subdirectories).

## Central tool + local product (multiple products)

```text
~/projects/
├── QEAutoAI/
│   └── .loop-engineer/      # local memories/, plan/main_plan.md, state.db
├── OtherProduct/
│   └── .loop-engineer/      # separate local memory
~/.loop-engineer/app/        # shared tool runtime
```

```bash
cd ~/projects/QEAutoAI
loop setup --use-cwd --name qeautoai
```

## Environment variables

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `LOOP_ENGINEER_HOME` | Override home (default `~/.loop-engineer`) - `app/`, `bin/`, and `data/` all live under this |
| `LOOP_HOME` | Alias for `LOOP_ENGINEER_HOME` |

## Updates

```bash
loop update    # updates ~/.loop-engineer/app only
loop doctor    # checks app + active workspace
```

Data (global `data/` or local `.loop-engineer/`) is never touched by `loop update`.

## Migrating from the old flat layout

If you have an existing install predating the `app/data` and `.loop-engineer/`
split (files sitting loose directly in `~/.loop-engineer/` or your product
folder root), run:

```bash
loop migrate legacy-layout                        # global, dry-run
loop migrate legacy-layout --apply                 # global, apply
loop migrate legacy-layout --workspace <product>    # local, dry-run
loop migrate legacy-layout --workspace <product> --apply   # local, apply
```

Dry-run by default. Only moves an explicit allowlist of Loop-Engineer-owned
paths - never touches your actual product code. For local mode, `docs/` and
`skills/` are flagged rather than auto-moved (a real product may have its own),
except the three known Loop-Engineer-generated files under `docs/`.

## Session bootstrap read order

1. `plan/SESSION_MANIFEST.md` (after `loop session-start`)
2. `memories/SOUL.md`
3. `memories/USER.md`
4. `memories/MEMORY.md`
5. `CONTEXT.md`
6. `plan/main_plan.md`, `HANDOFF.md`, active feature `spec.md` / `tasks.md` (when set)
7. `plan/SESSION_RECALL.md`, `plan/AUTO_SKILLS.md`, `plan/AUTO_AGENT_SKILLS.md`

All paths above are relative to the resolved data root (`~/.loop-engineer/data/`
or `<product-folder>/.loop-engineer/`).

Feature specs: `plan/features/` - see `docs/FEATURE_WORKFLOW.md`

Always-on lifecycle: `docs/SESSION_LIFECYCLE.md`

Use `loop bootstrap` or `loop session-start` to refresh the manifest.
